# Economic Data Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and saved models developed for economic data analysis, regression modeling, boosting algorithms, and time series forecasting. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and statistical techniques to derive insights and make predictions on economic indicators.

## Project Structure

### Notebooks
- **Boost.ipynb**: This notebook explores boosting algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost) to enhance predictive accuracy on the economic dataset.
- **regression.ipynb**: Implements various regression models to analyze relationships among economic indicators. Includes model evaluation and performance metrics.
- **Time_series.ipynb**: Conducts time series analysis and forecasting, using methods such as ARIMA and LSTM to predict future trends based on historical economic data.
- **dataset_creation.ipynb**: Contains data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, transformation, and merging of raw datasets into the final_dataset.csv file used across models.

### Data Files
- **final_dataset.csv**: A consolidated dataset with key economic indicators used for training and testing machine learning models.
- **Individual CSV files**: These files represent various economic indicators:
  - **exports.csv**, **imports.csv**: Trade data.
  - **foreign-direct-investment.csv**, **gdp-growth-rate.csv**, **gdp_per_capita_change.csv**: Economic growth and investment data.
  - **hunger-statistics.csv**, **inflation-rate-cpi.csv**, **poverty-rate.csv**: Socioeconomic metrics.
  - **population-2024-07-23.csv**: Population estimates.
  - **tourism-statistics.csv**, **trade-gdp-ratio.csv**: Tourism data and trade-to-GDP ratio.

### Models
- **model1.keras**: A saved Keras model used in the project for predictive analysis.
- **model2.keras**: A more complex or large-scale Keras model trained on the dataset for improved performance.

### Checkpoints
- **.ipynb_checkpoints/**: Contains autosaved versions of the Jupyter notebooks.
